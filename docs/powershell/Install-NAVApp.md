# Install-NAVApp.ps1

This script is used to manage the lifecycle of a NAV App in a Business Central server instance.

## Summary

1. **Parameters**: The script accepts three parameters - `$srvInst` (the server instance), `$appPath` (the path to the app), and `$ForceSync` (a switch to force synchronization).

2. **Prepare PowerShell for default BC18 installation**: The script sets the execution policy to unrestricted, checks if the 'Cloud.Ready.Software.NAV' module is available, and if not, installs it.

3. **Color description**: The script sets up color-coded output for different types of messages (info, success, error, etc.).

4. **Function "AddAppToDependentList"**: This function is used to create a list of all apps that depend on the given `$appName`.

5. **Check parameters and app version**: The script checks if the app file exists and if the version of the app is already published.
